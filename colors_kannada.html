Paapa Pandu, is more or less the post marriage story of every man’s 
life. Pandu is married to Shrimathi, and they have two sons – Punda 
and SriHari.Punda is married to Charu. The story revolves around 
the conflict between Shrimathi & Charu and how the poor men face the 
consequences. To make it interesting, Shrimathi’s niece Nimmi from 
London also joins the house.“Paapa Pandu wrapped up years ago, but to this day, wherever I go, people never fail to ask me, ‘Sir, Silli Lalli matthe Paapa Pandu thara yavaga serial madtira? Tumba miss madkotivi adanna’. I’m surprised that people continue to talk about Paapa Pandu even today with such fondness that it’s both gratifying and humbling at the same time,” shares Chandru. He shares how during recent discussions with a channel, one of the ideas that was floated was a sitcom along the lines of Paapa Pandu. “And then the channel said, why not make Paapa Pandu itself? And while at it, also retain the same title? I, too, was more than happy to agree with this concept and the deal was sealed then and there,” says an elated Chandru.
