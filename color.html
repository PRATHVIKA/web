Bigg Boss is a reality show based on the original 
Dutch Big Brother format developed by John de Mol. 
A number of contestants (known as "housemates") live 
in a purpose-built house and are isolated from the rest 
of the world. Each week, housemates nominate two of their 
peers for eviction, and the housemates who receives the 
most nominations would face a public vote. Of these, one 
would eventually leave, having been "evicted" from the House.
 However, there were exceptions to this process as dictated 
 by Bigg Boss. In the final week, there were three housemates 
 remaining, and the public voted for who they wanted to win. 
 The housemates in the Indian version are primarily celebrities
 with the exception of one who is a non-celebrity selected via
 auditions. Housemates are overseen by a mysterious person 
 known as 'Bigg Boss', whose only presence in the house is 
 through his voice
